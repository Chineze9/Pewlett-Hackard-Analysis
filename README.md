# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis (explain the purpose of this analysis)
Assignments were given to us to determine the number of retiring employees per title and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a memtorship program.  And to write a detailed report of analysis that will help prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" as current employees reach retirement age.

Results (list 4 major points from 2 analysis)
Distinct with Orderby was used to remove duplicate rows as the company had switched tables over the years. The second reason being that the some employees had multiple titles inthe database due to promotions over the years.  Then we successfully used the ACCOUNT function that resulted in creating number of retirements-age employees by most recent job title.

A query was successfully used in creating a mentorship Eligibility Table that holds the employees who are eligible to participate in a Mentorship Program.


Summary (responses to the following questions)

Ten roles will have to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Harkard employees, because only seven professionals retired while ten roles were filled for mrntorship.
